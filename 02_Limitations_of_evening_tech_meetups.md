Limitations of evening tech meetups
===============================================

#### Promoting Participation

A key factor in driving attendance for an evening time tech meetup is proximity and ease of access to the meetup venue.

For an evening meetup, a criterion for sustaining attendence levels is that the chosen venue should be either in reasonable walking distance, or 
a very short and convenient commute. There has to be a critical mass of community members who are meet this criterion for a reasonable 
level of attendance.

#### Causes of non-participation

Evening meetups are inconvenient for people with young families, who must arrange childcare to permit attendance. 
This often manifests as a systematic bias against women.
