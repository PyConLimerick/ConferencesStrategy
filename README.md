Limerick Tech Conferences Strategy
====================================


As well as sustaining the local tech community, a Limerick Tech Conference strategy can address several issues facing the tech sector in the midwest.

 1. Talent attraction for larger companies
 2. Professional networking for local entrepreneurs to find "co-founders" to build start ups.

A Tech community conference in Limerick serves as a way of enticing tech workers in Dublin and Cork to visit Limerick for the day.

### Talent Attraction

The idea of moving down to Limerick for a job becomes more tangible, more so if there are other techies in Limerick for them to socialize with. A big psychological barrier is a fear of being isolated in a small city, where they don't know anybody. I can go into more detail about these matters, but I will save it for another time.


### Supporting Startups

The Tech startup scene in Dublin was, for a long time, sustained by informal meetups. They facilitated casual networking that allowed people to find the resources they were looking for to progress their projects (and, of course, hires).

Limerick can't sustain an evening time tech meetup scene the same way, due to lack of venues, and also a lack of a critical mass.

The optimal strategy for a city like Limerick is a pattern of weekend community events throughout the year.


### Venues

There are several locations that would serve as venues.

1. Thomond Park
2. The Strand Hotel
3. Cleeves Factory (being developed)
4. The old Dunnes Stores on Sarsfield St (the place can be easily fitted out for events until it is demolished)
