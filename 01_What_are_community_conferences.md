Technology Community Conferences
===============================

A tech community conference would be different from Academic conferences and Industry conference.

#### Tech Community Conferences

Tech Community conferences are typically held on weekends, with tickets priced on the assumption that the attendee is paying out of their own pocket.
Mostly they are attended by career young professionals, job-hunters and students.
Also Tech Community conferences cater more for more unusual content.
Many senior software engineers like this aspect particularly because it is often the first encounter with cutting edge technologies.

#### Industry Conferences

For Industry conferences, the key difference is cost, content and what day the event is held.

* Industry conferences are rarely held on weekend.
* Tickets cost a lot more as the attendees employer usually buys them.
* Mostly facilitate Business to Business relationships.
* Not useful for Talent attraction, because attendees are not typically job-hunting.

#### Academic Conferences

For Academic Conferences the primary difference is format and curation. 
Academic conference are vehicles for communicating research.
